# CADProject
Semester project for APSC 171 - Engineering Drawing and CAD

For this project, we had to design and prototype a way to promote active modes of transportation (i.e. biking, walking, running etc).

Our group created the ElecTrike, a modified tricycle to lessen physical strain and improve rider experience. The ElecTrike is an upgraded tricycle (trike) equipped with features to improve eco-friendliness, accessibility, and comfort. These key features include a retractable, weather-proof cover for protection from rain or shine, a windshield, a built-in fan for cooling, independent front-wheel control to improve stability, a widened, reclined seat for extra comfort, an insulated storage container for extra space, and finally, an electric motor for adjustable effort levels.
